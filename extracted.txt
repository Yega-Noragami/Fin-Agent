The Concentration Conundrum 
What to do about market dominance
Guillaume Jaisson

Stock market concentration has increased dramatically and has taken three broad
•
forms: the rise in the share of the US equity market in the world, the rise in the
share of the technology sector, and the rise in the dominance of the biggest
companies in most regions.
But, does it really matter for investors that markets have become more
•
concentrated and what, if anything, can they do about it? In this piece we look at
each of these areas of increased market concentration, place them in historical
context, and look at the implications and possible investment strategies to hedge
concentration risk.
Market dominance is not unprecedented and is only a problem if it is not supported
•
by fundamentals. That said, at the stock level in particular, dominant companies
rarely stay the best performers over long periods of time. We therefore examine
strategies to diversify. We recommend a more diversified geographical exposure.
We identify a group of Global Ex Technology Compounders (the ETCs) and
selected value compounders.

Concentration Consternation 
In recent years there has been signiﬁcant growth in equity market concentration; this 
theme has taken three forms: 
At the market level: the rise in the weight of the US in global stock markets.
1.
At the sector level: the rise in the weight of the technology sector within the US, in
2.
particular.
At the stock level: the increased dominance of the so-called Magniﬁcent 7 in the
3.
US, the GRANOLAS in Europe, and the top 30 stocks in Japan.
The question for investors is: does it really matter that markets have become more 
concentrated and what, if anything, can they do about it? In this piece we look at each 
of these areas of increased market concentration, place them in historical context, and 
look at the implications and possible investment strategies. 
1. Market concentration by country: US equity market hegemony
The US equity market has seen an extraordinary rise in value since the global ﬁnancial 
crisis (GFC), strongly outpacing that of other major markets, and taking its share of the 
global equity market to 50%. This is high by historical standards, although not unique. 
The equity market had a higher share in the global markets in the early 1970s, although 
the drivers were very different. In that period, the seven largest companies belonged to 
the oil sector (Exxon and Mobil), the autos sector (Ford, GM and Chrysler) together with 
General Electric and IBM. 
Over the following 50 years, the US equity market has consistently been the world’s 
biggest, although it brieﬂy fell to less than 30% of the world in the late 1980s, when it 
was overtaken by Japan. At the peak of its bubble in 1989, the Nikkei hit 38,915 – a level 
that it has recently ﬁnally surpassed over nearly 35 years later. The four biggest 
companies in the world in 1989 were all Japanese banks (Industrial Bank of Japan, 
Sumitomo Bank, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank). Six of the 10 biggest companies in 
the world were Japanese. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Japanese market, the 
US once again resumed its leadership in the global equity market.

The longer-term rise in the relative size of the US equity market has reﬂected the 
dominance of the US economy. Nonetheless, it is interesting that the US equity 
market’s domination of the world market has accelerated dramatically in recent years – 
particularly since the global ﬁnancial crisis – and its gains have outstripped those of 
other regions (Exhibit 2).

Similarly, while the US economy has been the biggest global economy over the past 50 
years, the share of equity market capitalisation relative to GDP has risen steadily in the 
US, although not so in the rest of the world (Exhibit 3). Some of this, however, reﬂects 
the fact that many non-US companies now reside within the US stock market. 
Only Switzerland and Denmark (much smaller economies) have stock market values that 
are bigger on a relative basis as a share of the economy (Exhibit 4). In Denmark’s case, 
this mainly reﬂects the size of Novo Nordisk, whose stock market value alone is bigger 
than the annual GDP of the Danish economy.

Why has the US outperformed, and is this a problem? 
There are very good reasons why the US equity market has outperformed and become 
more dominant. First, as Exhibit 5 shows, over the period since the GFC the US stock 
market has simply outgrown others in terms of earnings growth. 
 
Second, over the same period, the ‘Growth’ factor has consistently outperformed the 
‘Value’ factor as interest rates continued to fall, thereby pushing up the relative valuation

of longer-duration assets. This brieﬂy reversed during the early phase of rising interest 
rates in 2022, but has since continued (Exhibit 6).  
 
The outperformance of the US equity market since the GFC has mapped the 
outperformance of the ‘Growth’ factor, particularly relative to the rest of the world. Put 
another way, the US stock market has more exposure to faster growing industries than 
the rest of the world, and less exposure to slow growing companies. Many mature, 
value-orientated sectors faced speciﬁc headwinds after the ﬁnancial crisis. Banks 
needed to recapitalise and cut dividends, while commodity-related companies suffered 
from falling prices as end-demand was weak. There are other explanations of US 
outperformance: 
The reinvestment rate of companies in the US stock market is higher than in 
n
most other markets. The ability and willingness to reinvest at a high rate in 
companies that are growing is contributing to the relative lead of the US market. 
This is particularly so in the technology sector. The US also beneﬁts, relative to other 
markets, from having comprehensive and unique support ecosystems, including 
collaboration with universities and the government, incubator and accelerator funds, 
VC and PE funds.  
The liquidity of the US stock market is much higher than for other markets, 
n
helping to reduce the risk premium. The US equity market is increasing its depth 
relative to other markets. Geopolitical concerns and government involvement has 
reduced global appetite in some emerging markets, and in particular in China. 
Meanwhile, Europe has much poorer liquidity than the US. The US has also attracted 
investment and companies as a result of government incentives, tariffs on imports 
and the Inﬂation Reduction Act (IRA).

The US economy is bigger and stronger than others and the growing trend 
n
towards US listings by foreign-based companies has added to this effect; it means 
that a growing part of the value of foreign-originated companies are represented in 
the US market. Furthermore, even if not listed in the US, many European and other 
companies have generally increased their exposure (and assets) in the US (Exhibit 
7).  
 
That said, while fundamentals have driven the ascent of the US, its equity market has 
also become increasingly expensive relative to the rest of the world, even when taking 
into account the differences in sector weights (Exhibit 8).

Nevertheless, ths premium remains justiﬁed by superior rates of return on capital and 
the US valuation premium is not extreme when adjusting for its higher level of 
proﬁtability and returns on equity (Exhibit 9).  
 
What should Investors do about it? 
Our view is that the size of the US equity market relative to others does not matter as

long as it is supported by the fundamentals. In addition, when considering the size of 
the US market we also need to consider that other markets are highly correlated with 
the US. So, the value of diversiﬁcation is not always as high as people think, particularly 
in Europe (Exhibit 10).  
The best diversiﬁcation opportunity in DM is Japan, which we view primarily as a 
restructuring opportunity, which we like and are overweight. We see the best 
diversiﬁcation opportunities overall, however, in emerging markets. In our view, India, in 
particular, which we like, is a good Growth opportunity; China offers good diversiﬁcation 
and is a Value opportunity (our Strategy team in Asia are overweight); and the Middle 
East also offers good diversiﬁcation characteristics although our view here is more 
mixed – see EM in Focus: The “One Chart-er”
.  
On balance, while we like the US market and believe its relative growth is based on 
strong fundamentals, we also believe that increased geographical diversiﬁcation is 
justiﬁed. Put another way, we believe that there are many companies outside of the US 
that should be considered as part of a global diversiﬁed portfolio and should not be 
ignored simply because their base and listing location is outside of the US. Many quality 
growth companies exist in other regions that have globally diversiﬁed revenue streams 
and could be useful diversiﬁers in a US-dominated portfolio.

2. Market concentration by sector; the rise of Technology 
Another form of market concentration that has emerged in markets over recent years is 
at the sector level, particularly with the rise of the technology sector. Once again, this is 
more obvious in the US than in other markets, but it has become a feature of many 
other markets too, particularly in Asia. 
 
This relative growth is not of concern, in our view, because it is reﬂective of relative 
fundamental earnings growth. Exhibit 13 shows that, while global technology proﬁts 
have surged since the ﬁnancial crisis, other sectors in aggregate have made virtually no 
progress. The differential continued in the pandemic recession as social distancing 
further supported demand for technology relative to other parts of the economy. While

the rise in interest rates over the past couple of years dented the relative earnings 
growth of the technology sector, its superior growth rate has resumed over the past 
year and many of the biggest technology companies, which are already proﬁtable and 
have signiﬁcant cash piles, have actually beneﬁted from higher interest rates and a 
signiﬁcant focus on cost reduction. They have sufﬁcient cash to reinvest at a very high 
rate without being impacted by higher borrowing rates.

It is also worth remembering that the current dominance of the technology sector, even 
in the US equity market, is not unprecedented relative to other dominant sectors in the 
past. Exhibit 14 shows the biggest sector in the US equity market over time. The 
Information Technology and Communications industry is the biggest but this is by no 
means exceptional. Over the past 200 years, the biggest industry represented in the 
stock market at each point in time has reﬂected the major driver of economic growth. 
The Technology sector is about the same size as the Energy sector was at its height in 
the mid-1950s. It remains smaller in the index than both Transport (which dominated in 
the 20th century) or ﬁnance and real estate which drove the dominant part of the equity 
market in the 19th century.

The very rapid growth rates in companies associated with AI has fuelled a further rise in 
the relative exposure of this sector, but it is about the same size as the energy sector on 
a relative basis at its peak in the 1950s.  
What should Investors do about it? 
While we like technology and are overweight in all regions, we think there are good 
opportunities to hedge technology dominance by: 
1. Diversifying technology exposure with selected ‘growth’ that is cheaper. 
One way to diversify from technology is to supplement it with other growth exposures. 
Healthcare is a sector that we overweight in all regions (except Japan). It remains 
relatively cheap but also has high prospective growth. Furthermore, in time, we see this 
sector as being a beneﬁciary of AI technologies.

Another growth diversiﬁer is the European GRANOLAS, 11 of the largest companies in 
the STOXX 600. These stocks trade at a lower valuation (around 20x P/E) than the 
Magniﬁcent 7 and have performed well. They share some similar characteristics to the 
technology leaders; they have strong balance sheets, are reporting high proﬁts, and have 
similarly high and stable margins. And, like healthcare and the Magniﬁcent 7
, they are 
reinvesting at a high rate, allowing them to compound earnings over time.

2. Diversify into the Ex 
T
ech Compounders (the ETCs) 
Related to point 1 above, we think there are many ‘quality compounders’ outside of the 
technology sector that look attractive. We call these the Ex 
T
ech Compounders, or 
ETCs. 
We have put together a list of global ETCs, which can be found in the Appendix. The list 
looks for companies that have market caps above $10bn and have high margins (EBITDA 
> 14%, EBIT > 12%, Net Income > 10%), high proﬁtability (ROE > 10%), strong balance 
sheets (ND/Equity < 75%, ND/EBITDA < 2x), low volatility (Vol < 50), strong growth 
prospects (sales > 4% and earnings > 8%) and have consistently grown their earnings 
over the past decade. 
As Exhibit 18 shows, both the GRANOLAS in Europe and the ETCs have outperformed 
the global market over the past year and have kept pace with the performance of the 
Magniﬁcent 7
. The valuation of our global ETCs list is in line with its average since 2016 
and the list trades at the lowest premium to the world stock market since 2018.

3. Complement Quality Growth with some Value. 
i) In the US, we have an overweight on energy and ﬁnancials.  
ii) In Europe, we all have an overweight on consumer cyclicals (with activity 
rebounding/high savings/real wage growth). 
iii) In Asia, we recommend selected Value, including Cash Returns, which the market is 
rewarding: High Dividend 
Yield with Growth (GSSZDIVG) together with a Value 
Focus, especially given the focus on value unlocks in Japan and Korea: Value Basket 
(GSSZVALU). 
3. Concentration by stock; the growth of the Magniﬁcent 7 and GRANOLAS 
The issue of stock concentration is perhaps the one that attracts the most attention. This 
is understandable because in many cases active managers cannot gain sufﬁcient 
exposure to the largest stocks to beneﬁt from their performance given restrictions on 
stock concentration within portfolios. In the US, the 10 largest companies have reached 
over 30% of the market value of the S&P 500, the highest level since 1980. Our US 
colleagues have explored the implications in detail in: US Equity Views - 100 years of US 
equity market concentration and momentum.

While the focus is predominantly on the US, there has been a similar pattern to varying 
degrees in many other markets. Europe has the highest concentration since the GFC, 
and is approaching the record levels of concentration seen during the technology 
bubble. In particular, the group of GRANOLAS stocks account for nearly one quarter of 
the value of the 600 biggest companies in Europe. That said, these companies are more 
diversiﬁed by industry with representation across technology, healthcare, luxury and 
consumer staples.

Indeed, the Magniﬁcent 7 and the GRANOLAS have generated over half of their 
respective market returns over the past couple of years.  
 
Similarly, although the Japanese market appears to be less concentrated, the 
comparison is unfair since the Topix has nearly 2000 companies;  the 30 largest 
companies in the Topix have increased their relative size to the 97th percentile since 
1995, making their share as a proportion of the market very similar to the concentration

26).  
 
Does high stock market concentration reﬂect a bubble? 
While high stock market concentration may be a sign of a bubble, it does not necessarily 
mean there is one. For example, when Japan’s stock market brieﬂy became the world’s 
largest, and reached a P/E of 67x, the biggest companies in the index were banks, but 
the market was not particularly concentrated.  
Furthermore, while the biggest stocks in the US equity market are much bigger today as 
a share of the market compared with the stock market bubble of 2000, current 
valuations are much lower than have been typical in other recent bubble periods, 
stretching back to the Nifty 50 era of the early 1970s, the Japanese bubble in the late 
1980s, and indeed the technology bubble in 2000 (Exhibit 27).

Perhaps more importantly, however, the current dominant companies are much more 
proﬁtable and have stronger balance sheets than those that dominated during the tech 
bubble (Exhibit 28).

Furthermore, high stock concentration is not unusual. As Exhibit 29 shows for the US 
equity market, the biggest company over time has often been bigger than the biggest 
company today.  
 
The power of the dominant companies to generate shareholder returns and compound 
over time is a feature that has been recognised in much of the literature on the subject.

had publicly listed equity since 1929 and found that, over time, while aggregate wealth 
creation had been $47
.4 trillion, the majority reduced shareholder wealth. He also found 
that the extent to which stock market wealth creation is concentrated in a few 
companies has increased over time. One of the reasons for this may be the growing 
issue of scale required in dominant technology platforms, particularly when it comes to 
compute power and R&D spending.  Another factor, which might exacerbate these 
fundamentals, is the growth of passive relative to active investment (Exhibit 30). This 
can make ‘Momentum’ an important factor as the ‘winners’ get bigger over time as 
more investment backs these companies.

Is high stock concentration a big risk? 
Historically, with new entrants emerging, few companies remain unscathed as 
competition either forces companies to disappear, merge or be acquired. From this 
perspective, a market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes 
increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation. 
There are, for example, only 52 companies that have appeared every year in the Fortune 
500 since 1955. In other words, just over 10% of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 
have remained on the list during the 69 years through this year2. Based on this 
history, it would appear reasonable to assume that when the Fortune 500 list is released 
70 years from now in the 2090s, almost all of today’s top companies will no longer exist 
as currently conﬁgured and will be replaced by new companies in new, emerging 
industries that we can’t even imagine today.

Innovation tends to generate new technologies, products and markets; alongside these, 
stockmarket leadership also tends to change. This process sometimes accelerates or 
slows down but since 1980, for example, more than 35% of S&P 500 constituents 
have turned over during the average 10-year period, largely reﬂecting innovation.  
Survivor bias means the index is continually reconstituted as less successful companies 
are replaced by new ﬁrms with better growth prospects. The last 20 years in particular 
have seen the emergence of a group of companies that have come to dominate the 
technology and related industries in a surprisingly rapid transformation of the business 
landscape. Of the current top 50 companies in the US, only half of them were in the top 
50 a decade ago, and many companies did not even exist before the 1990s (NVIDIA 
(1993), Amazon (1994), Netﬂix (1997), PayPal (1998), Alphabet (1998), Salesforce (1999), 
Tesla (2003) and Facebook (2004)).  
As a result of changes in leadership and, by implication, growth, history would suggest 
that buying dominant companies generates lower returns over time. For example, 
Exhibit 32 shows the total return on average since 1980 that would have been achieved 
by buying and holding the top 10 stocks over different time horizons (from 1 year out to 
10 years), while Exhibit 33 shows the same in relative returns (compared with the S&P 
500). These data suggest that, while absolute returns remain good for the dominant 
companies, these strong returns fade over time. Importantly, however, the returns are 
generally negative for dominant companies if an investor buys and holds them as other 
faster-growing companies come along and outperform them. 
Nevertheless, this does not mean that these companies would necessarily be poor 
investments. They may well remain good compounders, be more defensive and enjoy 
lower volatility and higher risk-adjusted returns.

Exhibit 34 and Exhibit 35 show that the current dominant group of companies has 
performed better in absolute and relative terms compared with dominant companies in 
the past. Again, none of this suggests that the current dominant companies will perform 
poorly or will not be good investments, but it does suggest that investors should look 
elsewhere for the next group of high-growth companies. 
What should Investors do about it? 
Investors face a ﬂatter trajectory for equity markets over the next few years as a higher 
cost of capital and less globalisation mean lower returns (see our Global Strategy Paper 
on the Post Modern Cycle). Under these conditions, we think investors should employ a 
barbell approach:  
Defensive, strong balance sheet growth companies that are reinvesting and able to

compound superior earnings growth - like the ETCs. 
Mature companies that are cash-generative and are able to buy back shares and pay

A guiding principle at Morgan Stanley Research is to enhance 
your investment process by delivering unique insights that 
separate the signal from the noise. An intuitively designed and 
well-crafted chart can often accomplish this with exceptional 
clarity.  
With that mission in mind, these charts in our recently published research stood out 
to me.  
1. Powering GenAI: We believe the market under-appreciates the mismatch 
between AI's rapid growth in power demand growth and the slow growth in 
power supply. 
2. Europe Equity Strategy: Our analysis of corporate mentions of thematic 
drivers supports our bullish view. 
3. Europe Equity Strategy /  
Valuation: European corporates' cash return to 
shareholders is trending at a multi-year high.
4. US and Asia Economics: Trade data suggest that onshoring of US 
manufacturing limited to date, but sources of US imports have become more 
diversified.
5. US Large Cap Banks: We are bullish on the ongoing capital markets 
rebound, and we see money center banks as a way to play that dynamic. 
6. US Equity Strategy: We raise our Energy sector allocation to overweight  
based on inflecting relative earnings revisions, strong breadth, and 
compelling valuation.
7. US Rates Strategy: Treasury yields followed inflation higher, but have not 
followed inflation lower - but we expect that to change as the market 
squares the growth / inflation dilemma. 
8. Copper / Anglo American:  
We believe the near-term backdrop favors 
copper-exposed miners; Anglo's high-quality copper division could help drive 
a re-rating for the diversified miner. 
Please reach out to me with feedback on these or any other key investment debates. 
Thank you for your partnership.

Powering GenAI
The Tortoise and the Hare: Market Under-appreciates the 
Mismatch Between  
AI Power Demand Growth and Supply 
Growth 
Our Sustainability Research Strategists, in collaboration with a broad range of sector 
analysts globally, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the economics of new data 
centers (DCs). They conclude that the market is under-appreciating 3 dynamics: (1) The 
rapid drop in the cost of GenAI compute power — their proprietary cost model shows 
that DCs’ capital cost per teraFLOPS drop by ~50% when moving from NVIDIA’s Hopper 
GPU to its new Blackwell GPU; (2) A significant mismatch between the hyper-rapid growth 
in GenAI power needs (notwithstanding continued efficiency improvements) and the slow 
growth in power grid infrastructure; and (3) The resulting very large magnitude of the 
time value for power solutions providers that can reduce the delay in powering new and 
expanded data centers. Our teams recommend investing in companies that are well 
positioned to serve the rapidly growing power needs of the GenAI enablers — they 
highlight 13 Overweight-rated stocks: AES, Bloom Energy, Constellation Energy, ENGIE, 
Fortum, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy, Orsted, PSEG, RWE, SembCorp, Tenaga, and Vistra

Europe Equity Strategy
Analysis of Thematic Drivers Supports Our Structurally 
Bullish View
Our Europe Equity Strategy team used AlphaSense's LLM technology to parse 300,000+ 
earnings and conference transcripts over 20 years to identify which themes are rising or 
shifting in the conversation in Europe’s C-suites. Their work shows that thematic waves of 
AI diffusion, capital returns, margin discipline, “green shoots”, and M&A are on the rise in 
the region. AI is the clear leader, with 32% of European companies discussing it this 
quarter, moving up in a straight line and almost catching up with the US trend. Meanwhile, 
they saw a decline in management mentions of “economic uncertainty”, “energy costs”, 
and “inflation”. They believe the results support their bullish view that the rally in the 
region’s equities is transforming from a catch-up trade to a more material fundamental 
shift

Europe Equity Strategy / Valuation
European Corporates' Cash Return to Shareholders Is 
Trending at a Multi-Year High
European corporates’ discussions of “cash return” has translated into strong actual 
shareholder remuneration, according to work by our Global Valuation, Accounting, and 
Tax (GVAT) Strategists. The team publishes quarterly analyses of corporates’ sources of 
cash, and perhaps more importantly, how they have deployed that cash. They found that, 
commensurate with management mentions of “capital return”, Europe’s corporates’ actual 
total shareholder return (dividends + buybacks) edged higher in 4Q to approach a multi-
year high. The region’s corporates returned ~40% of the cash they generated to 
shareholders, in line with the trend over the past few quarters.

US and Asia Economics
Onshoring of US Manufacturing Limited to Date, but Sources of US Imports Have Become 
More Diversified
The trade policy debate typically becomes prominent during a US election cycle, and data 
from our Asia Economics team can help offer context for this debate. Our team argues 
that if trade policy was intended to bring manufacturing back onshore into the US, 
headline metrics suggest limited traction so far. They note that the US trade deficit has 
widened even further since 2017 and the US’s share of global imports has remained 
around 13%, suggesting that there has been very limited onshoring to date. However, they 
see some initial signs of greater diversification: the US is now importing much less from 
China than in 2017 and has diversified its import sources. China’s import share in the US 
has dropped from 21.6% in December 2017 to 13.9% in December 2023. Over the same 
time period, the Euro Area has gained the most market share in US imports, after Mexico, 
and alongside Vietnam, India, and Canada.

US Large-Cap Banks
We Are Bullish on the Ongoing Capital Markets Rebound, 
and We See Money Center Banks as a Way to Play It
Our US Financials sector analysts are bullish on a rebound in capital markets activity, with 
M&A, Equity Capital Markets, and Debt Capital Markets as a percent of US nominal GDP 
all running near 3-decade lows. Our team believes that the money center banks — Bank 
of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, all of which they rate Overweight — are a 
way to play this view. They expect these banks to see the fastest revenue growth rate in 
their Corporate & Investment Banking segments, followed by Asset & Wealth 
Management, and capital markets drive a weighted average 57% of these bank’s total 
revenues, on their estimates. Turning to valuation, Corporate & Investment Banking 
represents the single largest component of our analysts’ sum of the parts (SOTP) 
valuation of each of the four capital markets banks they cover.

US Equity Strategy
Raise Energy Sector Allocation to Overweight: Inflecting 
Relative Earnings Revisions, Strong Breadth, Compelling 
Valuation 
Our US Equity Strategists have raised their recommended allocation to the Energy sector 
to overweight. The sector's relative performance versus the S&P 500 has lagged the price 
of crude YTD. Add in inflecting relative earnings revisions, strong breadth, and compelling 
valuation (8th percentile of historical EV/EBITDA levels), and our team thinks there could 
be a catch-up in Energy equities. Further, they continue to believe we are in a late-cycle 
market environment, which has historically been supportive of Energy outperformance. 
Finally, proprietary Morgan Stanley data suggest hedge fund net exposure to the sector is 
low vs. history

US Rates Strategy
Treasury Yields Followed Inflation Higher, but Have Not 
Followed Inflation Lower; We Expect That to Change
Our US Interest Rate Strategists note that despite the decline in core PCE inflation that 
gained traction in 2023, 10-year yields have stayed stubbornly above 4%. Why? They point 
to the common narrative that the Fed could not be expected to cut amid strong economic 
growth and tight labor markets. But our Rates team views this as misguided, as our US 
Economists believe a strong rise in labor supply, in part due to high immigration, helps 
explain last year's strength in output and employment, and also adds a lagged 
disinflationary effect. Our Rates team sees room for Treasury yields to move lower as 
markets come to this view. Their analysis suggests that if Treasury rates had followed its 
previous relationship with inflation surprises, 10-year yields would be around 3.60% 
today.

Copper / Anglo American
The Copper Party
Our Europe Metals & Mining team notes that the disparity in total shareholder returns 
(TSR) between pure-play copper miners and the broader S&P Global Mining index has 
reached a post-2017 high. While they argue that the near-term backdrop favors copper-
exposed miners, they see value in shares of high-quality, cash-generative, diversified 
mining companies. They believe Anglo American (AAL.L, 1,931p, Overweight), a diversified 
minor, could also could see a valuation re-rating driven by its high-quality copper business 
should the company make progress on its portfolio review.

The bulk of the equity performance so far this year, and indeed in the past 18 
months, was driven by multiple expansion. Globally, 12m forward earnings 
are up only 7% from the lows, in contrast to nearly 30% P/E upmove - top 
table.  
Current US forward P/E multiple of 21.4x is up 6% ytd, up 20% since Oct 
˖23 and 30% from Oct ˖22 lows. European P/Es are up by a similar magnitude, 
but from a lower starting point. At sector level, the consistent valuation 
laggards during this near 30% P/E expansion are to be seen among Defensives, 
such as Utilities and Staples, but also in European Banks. Within the rerating, 
winners are generally Semis and Industrials.
•
2024 EPS projections are again down small in the US ytd, and are more 
meaningfully lower in Europe. At the same time, bond yields are higher, 
squeezing ERPs. Global earnings yield vs bond yield differential has been 
moving lower, to be now below 2007 levels - see middle chart. Central banks 
are set to deliver some cuts in 2H, but in order to justify current equity 
valuations, we believe that we will need to see at least some earnings 
acceleration, as well. 
•
The P/E expansion that took place is reflective of a view by investors that 
activity momentum is in the process of bottoming out, and that earnings growth 
is set to accelerate this year, and beyond. Indeed, IBES is projecting a 
sequential pickup in earnings growth between 2023 and 2026. 
•
Ultimately, equity valuations will end up responding to earnings momentum 
trends, as there is a clear historical correlation between P/E multiples and 
earnings revisions, with the last 18 months seeing an easing in the downtrend 
of earnings downgrades. The question is whether we will see an outright 
uptrend next? Our concern is that profit growth could underwhelm, for a 
number of reasons - see our recent report for details. If the earnings acceleration 
fails to materialize, this could act as a constraint, in particular for Cyclical 
sectors, which are currently trading at price and P/E relative highs vs 
Defensives - see report. 
•
Regionally, China equities showed no rerating over the past 18 months, 
still trading around 9x forward, which is at absolute and relative lows. 
Compared to past trends, Europe overall is clearly not expensive, it is US and 
Japan that have moved above historical ranges. Notably, Eurozone trailing 
buybacks yield is at present quite close to US - bottom chart. At the same 
time, Eurozone dividend yield at 3.0% is much higher than US at 1.3%, and 
bond yields are meaningfully lower - with these 3 together resulting in a much 
better total equity yield vs bond yield for Eurozone equities than for the 
US, of 240bp - we closed US vs Eurozone OW last week.
•
Overall, if central banks turn out to be more dovish than currently projected, 
but without this being accompanied by growth disappointments, present equity 
multiples could be defended. However, if activity momentum, and in particular 
earnings delivery, disappoints, and central banks end up more reactive than 
proactive, then we think that equity multiples would need to fall. 
See page 23 for analyst certification and important disclosures, including non-US analyst disclosures.

At a sector level, the divergence between Cyclical sectors and 
Defensives is clear. Semis have seen the strongest rerating in 
the past 18 months, while Defensives like Staples and Utili-
ties have lagged.

In Europe, beyond commodities which rerated, but had poor 
earnings delivery, Semis and Industrials were the winners, 
while again Staples and Utilities were among the biggest lag-
gards.

Lagging earnings delivery and higher bond yields have 
squeezed ERPs. Yield on equities no longer appears attrac-
tive, compared to other asset classes. In fact, the differential 
between the earnings yield and bond yield has now moved 
below 2007 levels.  
Consensus expectation is that earnings will accelerate 
from here, which should plug the valuation gap...

The bulls argue that earnings delivery will come, and that will 
end up justifying current multiple expansion. Indeed, IBES is 
projecting a meaningful acceleration in earnings growth this 
and next year.

Ultimately, the earnings momentum is key for equity valua-
tions, as per the very strong correlation between P/Es and 
EPS revisions seen in the above chart. While there was an 
easing in the downtrend of earnings downgrades in the past 
year, the concern is whether this can sustain.  
…we worry that the consensus expectations for  
an earn-
ings acceleration are too optimistic

We think that earnings delivery might underwhelm the opti-
mistic consensus projections for the following 4 reasons: 1. 
hurdle rate is high, with profit margins elevated in the histori-
cal context, as seen in the above chart, 2. pricing and topline 
are likely to keep normalizing, 3. Net interest expense is set 
to normalize, 4. ULCs could pick up on higher wages and 
lower productivity.

A cyclical improvement in productivity, helped by excess

acceleration, keeping ULCs low. These are likely to change

In addition, total shareholder yield looks increasingly attrac-
tive in the region. European stocks have historically had a 
higher dividend yield than their US peers, but the region typi-
cally lagged the US in terms of buybacks. This is changing, 
the buyback yield for the US and Europe appear to be con-
verging.

Finally, we have been OW Japan the whole of last year, and 
even though it has rerated, we note that it is not much above 
historical relative vs the World.  
If either the activity momentum, or the central banks, dis-
appoint, equity multiples could weaken

Investors at present have a full focus on Goldilocks setup, 
growth to have no landing but at the same time central banks 
are expected to be accommodative. If either of these assump-
tions proves to be wrong, there is a risk of derating. The 
above chart shows that Fed futures have fully round-tripped 
to last October levels, but equities are so far ignoring this.

Also, recession odds implied in the market are now at record 
lows, which might be too optimistic, as a number of positive 
drivers from last year, pent up demand, excess liquidity, 
extremely high job opening rate, fiscal stimulus, high corpo-
rate topline growth and elevated pricing power might be wan-
ing.

Equity Strategy Key Calls and Drivers
So far this year, US and Japan are ahead of other markets, Growth is outperforming Value and large caps are again beating small in all key regions. We continue to believe that this, ultimately unhealthy, 
high concentration and narrow leadership is set to stay for a while longer. To buy Value and International stocks one needs to see a reflationary backdrop, in our view, but we could have the opposite. in 
terms of bond yields, we argued last October to go long duration, but also in January to look for a tactical bounce back in bond yields, as Fed easing became overdiscounted in markets. We now think that 
the counter-rally in yields might be running out of steam, and would advocate to go long duration again. The move back higher in Fed futures might be getting done – they round-tripped back to October 
levels, and activity momentum could soften from here. The question is, why didn˖t equities weaken as US 10-year yields backed up 50bp during Jan-Feb? We think that this is because investors assumed 
that the yield upmove is reflective of economic acceleration, but we note that earnings projections for 2024 are not reacting positively – they keep coming down in most sectors. If the growth acceleration 
does not come through, this could act as a headwind. We  
last week closed UW Eurozone vs US trade, as relative growth disappointments for the region are likely at their peak and growth style in US is at 
a risk of a reversal given it is already so stretched.

Table 12: J.P. Morgan Equity Strategy — Key sector calls*
Sector
Recommendations
Key Drivers
Healthcare
Overweight
Potential for lower yields and stronger dollar remain near term support, earnings are also holding up
Staples
Overweight
Sector is one of the best performers around the last Fed hike in the cycle, lower bond yields and better relative EPS momentum 
should further support
Banks
Underweight
Downgraded to UW in October after 3 years of strong performance. Bond yields and PMIs direction is the key for the potential P/E 
re-rating of the sector, we think both will move lower
Chemicals
Underweight
The sector trades at 70% premium to the market, well above historical norm. pricing continues to deteriorate, downside risks to 
current earnings and margin projections

The Research Analyst(s) denoted by an “AC˙ on the cover of this report certifies (or, where multiple Research Analysts

with respect to each security or issuer that the Research Analyst covers in this research) that: (1) all of the views expressed in this report 
accurately reflect the Research Analyst˖s personal views about any and all of the subject securities or issuers; and (2) no part of any of the

Important Disclosures
 
Company-Specific Disclosures: Important disclosures, including price charts and credit opinion history tables, are available for compendium 
reports and all J.P. Morgan–covered companies, and certain non-covered companies, by visitinghttps://www.jpmm.com/research/disclosures, 
calling 1-800-477-0406, or e-mailing  research.disclosure.inquiries@jpmorgan.com with your request.
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: 
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will 
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst˖s, or the Research Analyst˖s team˖s, coverage universe); Neutral (over 
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the 
Research Analyst˖s, or the Research Analyst˖s team˖s, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in 
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst˖s, or the Research Analyst˖s 
team˖s, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock 
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the 
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) 
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock˖s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark 
country market index, not to those Research Analysts˖ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, 
the certifying Research Analyst˖s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan˖s Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.

We upgrade the Energy sector to overweight amid a 
combination of inflecting relative earnings revisions, strong 
breadth and compelling valuation. The recent stability of crude 
prices  
also points to a catch up in both relative performance and 
earnings growth, in our view.
• Great Expectations...Over the past five months, the MSCI All Country World 
Index is up ~25% while many other asset prices are up double digits or more.  
We think this rally has been mostly about looser financial conditions and 
falling cost of capital as a result of the Fed's 4Q dovish shift.  
Further 
multiple expansion in the US is likely dependent on an upward inflection in  
earnings expectations for 2024 and 2025, which have been flat at the S&P 
level since last October.
• Reflation Trades Back into Focus...With the Fed  
appearing to be less 
concerned about inflation or looser financial conditions, reflation trades are 
coming back into vogue. The internals of the market appear to be onto this 
with some of the strongest breadth coming from the commodity cyclicals. 
On this front,  
large cap Energy is a classic late cycle winner that has 
underperformed the market materially since last September, but has shown 
strong relative performance and breadth recently. As we lay out in today's 
note, we think this recent outperformance continues. We recommend staying 
up the cap and quality curve within the sector.  
• Upgrading Energy to Overweight...The sector's relative performance versus 
the S&P 500 has lagged the price of crude YTD, and Morgan Stanley’s 
Global Commodities Strategist, Martijn Rats, recently raised his Brent 
forecast to $90/bbl by 3Q given incrementally tighter supply/demand 
balances. This view on the commodity plus inflecting relative earnings 
revisions, strong breadth and compelling valuation (8th percentile of 
historical EV/EBITDA levels) suggest to us that the divergence between oil 
prices and the sector's relative performance is likely to close via a catch up in 
Energy equities. Further, free cash flow margin for the space remains well 
above its historical average, net debt to EBITDA remains below its long-term 
run rate and the sector remains under-owned based on hedge fund net 
exposure. On a single stock basis, our North American Energy Research team 
led by Devin McDermott recommends COP, DVN, OXY, and FANG.
Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 
companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, 
investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of 
interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley 
Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley

Great Expectations Suggest More Rotations
Over the past five months, the MSCI All Country World Index is up ~25% while many 
other asset prices are up double digits or more. What’s driving this appreciation? Many 
factors are at work, but for stock indices, we think it’s been mostly about easier financial 
conditions and higher valuations rather than improving fundamentals. Granted, higher 
asset prices often beget even higher asset prices as investors feel compelled to 
participate. From our perspective, it’s hard to justify the higher index-level valuations 
based on fundamentals alone, given that 2024 and 2025 earnings forecasts have barely 
budged over this time period.
We rolled out our “boom-bust” thesis in 2020 based on the shift to fiscally dominant 
policy in response to the pandemic. At that point, our positive view on stocks was based 
on the boom in earnings we expected over the 2020-21 period as the economy roared 
back from pandemic lows. Our outlook anticipated both accelerating top-line growth and 
massive operating leverage as companies could reduce headcount and other costs while 
people were locked down at home. The result was the fastest earnings growth in 30 years 
and record-high margins/profitability – i.e., the boom in stocks was justified by the 
earnings boom that followed. Stock valuations were also supported by arguably the most 
generous monetary policy in history as the Fed slashed and held rates at zero long after 
the economy had bounced back from the pandemic. The Fed also continued quantitative 
easing throughout 2021, a year when S&P 500 earnings grew more than 45% to an all-
time high ( Exhibit 1 ).

bottom-up expectations for 2024 and 2025 S&P 500 EPS remain flat post the Fed’s 4Q 
dovish shift. Meanwhile, small cap EPS estimates are down 8% for 2024 and 6% for 2025, 
following the peak in front-end rates last October ( Exhibit 2 ). We think one reason for 
the muted EPS revisions since last fall, particularly in small caps, is the continued policy 
mix of heavy fiscal stimulus and tight front-end rates, which we see crowding out many 
companies and consumers. While the narrowness of equity market performance over the 
last year has been closely scrutinized, it’s just a reflection of the narrow earnings 
performance, in our view, and makes sense. This helps to explain why most stocks remain 
below their 2021 highs. As an offset, corporates are increasingly prioritizing operational 
efficiency — one of the key themes we have been focused on.  
A continued, broadening 
focus on efficiency gains that can offset cyclical headwinds and drive margins higher 
would certainly be a factor in taking earnings revisions higher from here.

The question for investors at this stage is whether the market can finally broaden out in a 
more sustainable fashion. As we noted last week, we’re starting to see breadth improve 
for several sectors. Looking forward, we believe a durable broadening comes down to 
whether other stocks/sectors can deliver on earnings growth. One sector showing strong 
breadth is Industrials, a classic late-cycle winner and a beneficiary of major fiscal outlays 
(e.g., IRA and the CHIPS Act) and the AI-driven data center buildout. A new sector 
displaying strong breadth is Energy ( Exhibit 3 ), which is the best performer over the last 
month but is still lagging considerably since the October rally began. Taking the Fed’s 
recent messaging into account and assuming it is less concerned about inflation or looser 
financial conditions, commodity-oriented cyclicals and Energy in particular could be due 
for a catch-up.  
It may also surprise some readers that Energy has contributed more to the 
change in S&P earnings since the pandemic than any other sector ( Exhibit 4 ), yet it 
remains one of the cheapest and most under-owned areas of the market (see below for 
more).

We point out that the Energy sector's relative performance versus the S&P 500 has 
lagged the price of crude YTD ( Exhibit 5 ). Morgan Stanley’s Global Commodities 
Strategist, Martijn Rats, recently raised his Brent forecast to $90/bbl by 3Q given 
incrementally tighter supply/demand balances. This view on the commodity plus inflecting 
relative earnings revisions, strong breadth and compelling valuation  
(see below) suggest 
to us that the divergence between oil prices and the sector's relative performance is likely 
to close via a catch up in Energy equities. Further, we continue to believe we're in a late 
cycle market environment, which has historically been supportive of Energy 
outperformance ( Exhibit 6 ).

On the valuation front, Exhibit 7  shows that subgroups across the sector look attractive 
on an EV/EBITDA and free cash flow yield basis. The sector overall is currently trading in 
just the 8th percentile of historical forward EV/EBITDA levels and in the 82nd percentile 
of historical forward free cash flow yield levels. In Exhibit 8  and Exhibit 9 , we illustrate  
that  
absolute and relative earnings revisions breadth for the Energy sector appears to be 
bottoming. Further, the recent upside in crude on a Y/Y basis, points to upside in forward 
EPS growth for the Energy sector ( Exhibit 10 ).

While free cash flow margins have come down slightly over the past 2 quarters, they 
remain well above the historical  
run rate ( Exhibit 11 ). In terms of leverage, the sector's net 
debt to EBITDA ratio remains below the historical average going back to 2010 ( Exhibit 
12 ). Positioning data also looks compelling—Energy is in just the 17th percentile of 
historical hedge fund net exposure levels ( Exhibit 13 ). Morgan Stanley’s North American 
Energy Research team led by Devin McDermott recommends a quality bias. On a single 
stock basis, they recommend COP, DVN, OXY, and FANG.

We  
monitor dispersion metrics on a percentile basis relative to history ( Exhibit 21 ). 
Dispersion levels have come down closer to median levels after being elevated for most 
of 2022. Looking under the surface, there is greater variance at the industry group level 
with a number of industries in their top quartile historically. Specifically, high dispersion is 
present in Auto and Household, while there are lower relative dispersion levels in Utilities, 
Telecom and Energy,  
suggesting macro factors are a driving force.

What's Retail Doing?
Our Quantitative Equity Strategy team recently introduced a novel way to track the 
activity of retail traders using publicly available data. We provide a few updates and key 
observations on the retail trader using this approach. 
A few key observations:
• Retail participation is currently at 9.4% of the total market volume, and at 66th%-
ile relative to the last 6 years. 
• Order imbalance was slightly negative at -0.1% (34th percentile relative to the last 
6 years).
• Imbalance was positive in most sectors, except Materials, Tech, Utilities and 
Industrials.

In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice.

buy recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.

Market dynamics & signs of Late-cycle: Our quant model has been classifying Asia/
EM equities in a mid-cycle phase since March 2023, and recommended picking 
stocks with Price Momentum, Balance Sheet Quality, and Consensus Revisions 
Leadership. However, their alpha efficacy has been fading sequentially since 
February. Per our last Biweekly, we discussed that the elevated factor volatility 
might lead the factor landscape to transition to late-cycle. In March MTD, we note 
that  
the  
sensitivity between Value/Growth rotation vs. UST 10Y yield (and DXY) has 
also been deteriorating. Such  
trading pattern  
rhymes with what we saw during 
historical late-cycles, and adds to our conviction to prefer  
Low Volatility style.

Key Takeaways
Alpha efficacy of  
mid-cycle factors have been fading out in Asia, via Momentum 
trade unwinding, crowded short covering on low Quality names.
Such unwinding was the most significant in APxJ over the last four weeks;  
we see 
a potential unwinding of Japan Momentum trades in April as likely. 
Concurrently, style rotation and price actions in Asia/EM  
are mostly responding 
to flows and risk sentiment, but not macro factors, e.g. UST yields.
These are the signs of transition from mid-cycle to late-cycle factor landscape. 
Our quant model suggests taking Low Volatility strategy for now.

Market Dynamics and Style Implications
Latest Style Performance Overview in Asia/EM
Momentum trades unwinding continued in APxJ/EM & The rising signs of Late-cycle 
Factor Dynamics:  
We note that the majority of market mid-cycle factors, e.g. Quality, 
Price Momentum, Consensus Revisions, were all fading out in alpha efficacy in March MTD 
( Exhibit 2 ). Meanwhile, the sensitivity of Value/Growth rotation against macro factors, 
e.g. UST bond yields,  
DXY, were deteriorating. These phenomenon were  
often seen in the 
historical late-cycle phase, in which investor sentiment and flows were the dominant 
drivers behind the market price actions.  
Meanwhile, the higher factor volatility and  
correlations across factors also lowered the 
diversification effect within equity investors' portfolios. Total volatility of the equity 
market is on the rise, and if it evolves further, hedge funds' deleveraging might accelerate, 
triggering further unwinding of Momentum trades ( Exhibit 3 ).

But if we compare the MTD  
vs. YTD performance, we note there are some changes in the 
market micro-structure level, implying that the Momentum trade in Japan might see a 
reversal shortly. 
The most significant one is the fade out of the momentum of Large-cap stocks in Japan in 
March MTD. Per what we discussed in the last Biweekly Perspectives,  
the top crowding 
risk in  
Japan was in  
Large-Cap stocks, particularly Banks and Automobiles, as of February 
month-end. However, the relative performance of Large-cap vs. Small-mid cap turned out 
to be muted in March. ( Exhibit 4 )
Secondly, we believe the seasonal tailwind of Japan  
Momentum trade may turn to be a 
headwind in April, as investors tend to cover shorts after dividend ex-dates. Our model 
recognizes a high consistency that Japan market price actions tend to trade on a reversal 
basis, in which stocks with high short interest outperformed. ( Exhibit 5 )

Macro and Market Dynamics That Matter
The charts and paragraphs  
below illustrate our latest views on market dynamics and style 
recommendations.  
i) Our model continues to highlight on-going risk of Momentum trades unwinding. 
Such unwinding has been dominated by "crowded short covering", which drove Chinese 
Growth/Tech stocks to outperform in Asia/EM since February. If history is any guide, the 
next phase of unwinding will likely be about the "crowded long selling", and Japan 
Momentum stocks,  
in particular those in Semis, Automobiles, and Financials, might face a 
short term headwind in April.

ii) Growth  
outperformed Value despite a higher UST 10Y Yield ( Exhibit 8 ): Bond 
futures markets have been pricing out Fed rate cut expectations YTD. US treasury bond 
yields trended higher  
in the last two weeks. However, Bond volatility (MOVE Index) 
trended lower, and JPY also depreciated against USD. In our quant model, these macro 
dynamics are taken as offsetting factors of tighter financial conditions. 
With support from short covering flows among Growth/Tech stocks, outperformance of 
Growth over Value has continued into March MTD, rounding up an in-line relative return 
of these two major styles in Asia/EM.

iii) Risk-off sentiment  
remains in Asia/EM: According to Morgan Stanley's Asia Risk 
Sentiment Indicator ( Exhibit 8 ), overall risk allocation among global asset owners 
continues to prefer low-risk assets as money market funds dominate fund inflows, and 
their appetite for  
EM equity funds remained  
lackluster. Per our flows tracking via EPFR 
data, net fund flows to EM equity have been on and off on a weekly basis YTD. We believe 
the strong DXY remains the key macro driver behind that. 
Comparing the risk sentiment in Asia vs. that in the US, we note a major decoupling with 
growing signs of greedy sentiment  
in US equity and global HY markets ( Exhibit 8 ). In our 
view, this could potentially lead to Momentum reversal in Asia, stemming from US equity 
market.

iv) Factor performance indicates that the market is in transition from mid-cycle to 
late-cycle phase: We note that various market mid-cycle factors have been losing their 
alpha efficacy from February onward. Many fundamentally solid companies 
underperformed in Asia/EM. i.e. stocks with high Quality balance sheets and consensus 
revisions leadership turned to underperform. Such a reversal of this long-lasting trading 
pattern is a meaningful sign that the market is no longer in a mid-cycle phase. From a 
quant perspective, we prefer Low Volatility strategy, and we suggest investors put risk 
management as the #1 thing to focus on in market late-cycle phase.

Note: The Utilization Ratio highlights the balance between  
demand and supply of stock 
loans. A stock might appear to have low levels of short interest only due to its lack of 
availability for shorting purposes. The Utilization Ratio measures the percentage of supply 
being covered by  
demand, and is calculated as short interest/actively available amount of 
stock loan supply. The active element refers to IHS Markit adjustments for small or inactive 
inventory.

Factor Monitor – Biweekly Update March  
22, 2024
Methodology
Factor return calculation: To evaluate historical factor performance, we rank stocks as at  
month-end within defined universes, and form  
quintile portfolios based on the underlying 
factor values. We go long the top quintile and short the bottom quintile (i.e., long the top 
20th percentile of stocks within the defined universe and  
short those in the bottom 20th 
percentile), rebalanced monthly. We then calculate the performance of the time series of 
this L/S market-neutral portfolio over various time horizons.
Composite formation: To calculate the composite factors, we first z-score the individual 
factor values at each monthly observation within the defined universe. Individual factor z-
scores are then averaged into composite scores for each stock on an equal-weighted basis.

Global Research Conflict Management Policy
Morgan Stanley Research has been published in accordance with our conflict management policy, which is available at www.morganstanley.com/institutional/research/conflictpolicies. A 
Portuguese version of the policy can be found at www.morganstanley.com.br
Important Regulatory Disclosures on Subject Companies
The equity research analysts or strategists principally responsible for the preparation of Morgan Stanley Research have received compensation based upon various factors, including quality 
of research, investor client feedback, stock picking, competitive factors, firm revenues and overall investment banking revenues. Equity Research analysts' or strategists' compensation is not 
linked to investment banking or capital markets transactions performed by Morgan Stanley or the profitability or revenues of particular trading desks.
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates do business that relates to companies/instruments covered in Morgan Stanley Research, including market making, providing liquidity, fund management, 
commercial banking, extension of credit, investment services and investment banking. Morgan Stanley sells to and buys from customers the securities/instruments of companies covered in 
Morgan Stanley Research on a principal basis. Morgan Stanley may have a position in the debt of the Company or instruments discussed in this report. Morgan Stanley trades or may trade 
as principal in the debt securities (or in related derivatives) that are the subject of the debt research report.
Certain disclosures listed above are also for compliance with applicable regulations in non-US jurisdictions.
STOCK RATINGS
Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, 
Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell.  
Investors should carefully read the definitions of all 
ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan 
Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone.  
In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice.  
An investor's decision 
to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.
Global Stock Ratings Distribution
(as of February 29, 2024)
The Stock Ratings described below apply to Morgan Stanley's Fundamental Equity Research and do not apply to Debt Research produced by the Firm.
For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with FINRA requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated 
and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, 
hold, and sell but represent recommended relative weightings (see definitions below). To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Overweight, our most positive stock rating, with a 
buy recommendation; we correspond Equal-weight and Not-Rated to hold and Underweight to sell recommendations, respectively.
